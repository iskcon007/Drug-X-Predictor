DrugX-Predictor 🔬💊
A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Regular and Non-Regular Drug Users**

This project analyzes patterns in drug consumption behavior and uses machine learning models to predict whether an individual is a regular or non-regular user. It aims to raise awareness of the health risks associated with substance abuse and provide a data-driven tool for early identification and prevention efforts.

📌 Project Title
Poisoning the Body, Destroying the Mind: The Alarming Health Toll of Drug Consumption – A Machine Learning Approach**

🧠 Project Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts drug usage behavior (regular or non-regular) based on demographic and personality traits.

📊 Dataset
- Source:UCI Drug Consumption Dataset
- Features:Age, Gender, Education, Big Five Personality Traits, Impulsiveness, Sensation Seeking
- Target:Binary classification — Regular vs. Non-Regular drug user
